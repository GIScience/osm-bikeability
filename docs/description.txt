This layer shows the bikeability-index in urban regions. The term ‚bikeability‘ means in this case the suitability of cycling. The index is composed of five bikeability indicators that were calculated from osm data: 
-	seperation from cars
-	length of infrastructure
-	density of bike parking spots
-	density of potential destinations
-	proportion of natural area
The final bikeability index value is the average of all five indicator values and standardized from 1 to 10.
1 means that the value is not sufficient at all. 10 means that the value is sufficient. 
To decide whether the indicator value is sufficient or not, several regions with high cycling attractivity were used as orientation.
